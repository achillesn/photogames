The Mobile Photo Game was an introductory game that took place in the framework of the Hocus Photus Network's activities, during the exhibition **SYNCHRON-e-CITIES** at **TAF** The Art Foundation Gallery the 1st June 2025. Participants were guided by **_Achilles Nasios_** to take photos in a quick action, from which the material of the final results came from. \
Afterwards, George Koutsouvelis introduced them to image editing techniques, so that they gained knowledge of editing the photo directly on the mobile phone. \
The aim was to render each one's experience of this event, photographically.\
Here we can see some of the first results:
