The Mobile Photo Game was an introductory game that took place in the framework of the Hocus Photus Network's activities, during the exhibition **SYNCHRON-e-CITIES** at **TAF** The Art Foundation Gallery the 1st June 2025. Participants were guided by _**Achilles Nasios**_ to take photos in a quick action, from which the material of the final results came from. 

Afterwards, **_George Koutsouvelis_** introduced them to image editing techniques, so that they gained knowledge of editing the photo directly on the mobile phone. 

The aim was to render each one's experience of this event, photographically.

Here we can see some of the first results:
