# The 10th PhotoGame

_(September 2019) _

I live in Agrinio, a city in western Greece.I am an amateur photographer since my job is a Physical Education teacherwith additional studies in psychology.I’ m also an obsessive collector of moments∙ simple moments, everyday moments, but moments that are not to be repeated. They make up my personal, symbolic journey through life.My third eye, that is, my photographic eye, is the expression medium of my visual unconscious which brings me closer to my own self.So, photography is my way of being alone, walking through myself and searching  my inner world in looking for my soul and  a special place where... we are all the same.
