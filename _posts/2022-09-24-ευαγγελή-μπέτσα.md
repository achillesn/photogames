The 11th Game -
_(June 2022)_ - For more than 30 years there has been a camera in my hands. Whether that was local photography groups in different parts of the city, school photography projects with my students when I was working as a teacher, photography lessons with Vasilis Gerontakos or Achilleas Nasios, photography online games organized by "Hocus Photus", I always enjoyed the bond with people, the experience and knowledge I gained and finally the effort I put in everything. The way I see it, photography is creativity for me, always searching for the picture, constantly pursuing to express my ideas and my feeling.
